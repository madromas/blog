# Simple, lightweight community blog
Another simple blog. This is working platform, some features are missing. Overall usable. Running on php 8.2. Translated to English. Anyone can fork it, and contribute to it.

## Install:

1. Run database.sql to your created database.
2. Change /includes/config.php to your database and website parameter.
3. Register new user and change permissions for that user in database to have Administrator privileges.
4. Enjoy!
